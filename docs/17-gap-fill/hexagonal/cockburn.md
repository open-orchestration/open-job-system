_Create your_
_application to work without either a UI or a database so you can run automated_
_regression-tests against the application, work when the database becomes_
_unavailable, and link applications together without any user involvement._

The Pattern: Ports and Adapters ( _Object Structural_)

Alternative name: _Hexagonal_
_Architecture_

Intent

Allow an application to equally be driven by users,
programs, automated test or batch scripts, and to be developed and tested in
isolation from its eventual run-time devices and databases.

As events arrive from the outside world at a port, a
technology-specific adapter converts it into a usable procedure call or message
and passes it to the application. The application is blissfully ignorant of the
nature of the input device. When the application has something to send out, it
sends it out through a port to an adapter, which creates the appropriate
signals needed by the receiving technology (human or automated). The
application has a semantically sound interaction with the adapters on all sides
of it, without actually knowing the nature of the things on the other side of
the adapters.

Motivation

One of the great bugaboos of software applications over the
years has been infiltration of business logic into the user interface code. The
problem this causes is threefold: First, the system can't neatly be tested with
automated test suites because part of the logic needing to be tested is
dependent on oft-changing visual details such as field size and button
placement; For the exact same reason, it becomes impossible to shift from a
human-driven use of the system to a batch-run system; For still the same reason,
it becomes difficult or impossible to allow the program to be driven by another
program when that becomes attractive.

The attempted solution, repeated in many organizations, is
to create a new layer in the architecture, with the promise that this time,
really and truly, no business logic will be put into the new layer. However,
having no mechanism to detect when a violation of that promise occurs, the
organization finds a few years later that the new layer is cluttered with
business logic and the old problem has reappeared.

Imagine now that _every_
piece of functionality the application offers were available through an API
(application programmed interface) or function call. In this situation, the
test or QA department can run automated test scripts against the application to
detect when any new coding breaks a previously working function. The business
experts can create automated test cases, before the GUI details are finalized,
that tells the programmers when they have done their work correctly (and these
tests become the ones run by the test department). The application can be
deployed in _headless_ mode, so only
the API is available, and other programs can make use of its functionality --
this simplifies the overall design of complex application suites and also
permits business-to-business service applications to use each other without
human intervention over the web. Finally, the automated function regression
tests detect any violation of the promise to keep business logic out of the
presentation layer. The organization can detect, and then correct, the logic
leak.

An interesting similar problem exists on what is normally
considered "the other side" of the application, where the application
logic gets tied to an external database or other service. When the database
server goes down or undergoes significant rework or replacement, the
programmers can't work because their work is tied to the presence of the
database. This causes delay costs and often bad feelings between the people.

It is not obvious that the two problems are related, but
there is a symmetry between them that shows up in the nature of the solution.

Nature of the Solution

Both the user-side and the server-side problems actually are
caused by the same error in design and programming -- the entanglement between
the business logic and the interaction with external entities. The asymmetry to
exploit is not that between _left_ and _right_ sides of the application but
between _inside_ and _outside_ of the application. The rule to
obey is that code pertaining to the _inside_
part should not leak into the _outside_
part.

Removing any left-right or up-down asymmetry for a moment,
we see that the application communicates over _ports_ to external agencies. The word "port" is supposed
to evoke thoughts of _ports_ in an
operating system, where any device that adheres to the protocols of a port can
be plugged into it; and _ports_ on
electronics gadgets, where again, any device that fits the mechanical and
electrical protocols can be plugged in. The protocol for a port is given by the
purpose of the conversation between the two devices. The protocol takes the
form of an application program interface (API).

For each external device there is an _adapter_ that converts the API definition to the signals needed by
that device and vice versa. A graphical user interface or GUI is an example of
an adapter that maps the movements of a person to the API of the port. Other
adapters that fit the same port are automated test harnesses such as FIT or
Fitnesse, batch drivers, and any code needed for communication between
applications across the enterprise or net.

On another side of the application, the application
communicates with an external entity to get data. The protocol is typically a
database protocol. From the application's perspective, if the database is moved
from a SQL database to a flat file or any other kind of database, the
conversation across the API should not change. Additional adapters for the same
port thus include an SQL adapter, a flat file adapter, and most importantly, an
adapter to a "mock" database, one that sits in memory and doesn't
depend on the presence of the real database at all.

Many applications have only two ports: the user-side dialog
and the database-side dialog. This gives them an asymmetric appearance, which
makes it seem natural to build the application in a one-dimensional, three-,
four-, or five-layer stacked architecture.

There are two problems with these drawings. First and worst,
people tend not to take the "lines" in the layered drawing seriously.
They let the application logic leak across the layer boundaries, causing the
problems mentioned above. Secondly, there may be more than two ports to the
application, so that the architecture does not fit into the one-dimensional
layer drawing.

The hexagonal, or ports and adapters, architecture solves
these problems by noting the symmetry in the situation: there is an application
on the inside communicating over some number of ports with things on the
outside. The items outside the application can be dealt with symmetrically.

The hexagon is intended to visually highlight

(a) the inside-outside asymmetry and the similar nature of
ports, to get away from the one-dimensional layered picture and all that
evokes, and

(b) the presence of a defined number of different ports -
two, three, or four (four is most I have encountered to date).

The hexagon is not a hexagon because the number six is
important, but rather to allow the people doing the drawing to have room to
insert ports and adapters as they need, not being constrained by a
one-dimensional layered drawing. The term _hexagonal_
_architecture_ comes from this visual effect.

The term "port and adapters" picks up the _purposes_ of the parts of the drawing. A
port identifies a purposeful conversation. There will typically be multiple
adapters for any one port, for various technologies that may plug into that
port. Typically, these might include a phone answering machine, a human voice,
a touch-tone phone, a graphical human interface, a test harness, a batch
driver, an http interface, a direct program-to-program interface, a mock
(in-memory) database, a real database (perhaps different databases for
development, test, and real use).

In the Application Notes, the left-right asymmetry will be
brought up again. However, the primary purpose of this pattern is to focus on
the inside-outside asymmetry, pretending briefly that all external items are
identical from the perspective of the application.

Structure

<!\[if !vml\]>![](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexFig2.png)<!\[endif\]>

Figure 2

Figure 2 shows an application having two active ports and
several adapters for each port. The two ports are the application-controlling
side and the data-retrieval side. This drawing shows that the application can
be equally driven by an automated, system-level regression test suite, by a
human user, by a remote http application, or by another local application. On
the data side, the application can be configured to run decoupled from external
databases using an in-memory oracle, or _mock_,
database replacement; or it can run against the test- or run-time database. The
functional specification of the application, perhaps in use cases, is made
against the inner hexagon's interface and not against any one of the external
technologies that might be used.

<!\[if !vml\]>![](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexFig3.png)<!\[endif\]>

Figure 3

Figure 3 shows the same application mapped to a three-layer
architectural drawing. To simplify the drawing only two adapters are shown for
each port. This drawing is intended to show how multiple adapters fit in the
top and bottom layers, and the sequence in which the various adapters are used
during system development. The numbered arrows show the order in which a team
might develop and use the application:

<!\[if !supportLists\]>1.<!\[endif\]>With a FIT test harness driving the application and
using the mock (in-memory) database substituting for the real database;

<!\[if !supportLists\]>2.<!\[endif\]>Adding a GUI to the application, still running off the
mock database;

<!\[if !supportLists\]>3.<!\[endif\]>In integration testing, with automated test scripts
(e.g., from Cruise Control) driving the application against a real database
containing test data;

<!\[if !supportLists\]>4.<!\[endif\]>In real use, with a person using the application to
access a live database.

Sample Code

The simplest application that demonstrates the ports &
adapters fortunately comes with the FIT documentation. It is a simple discount
computing application:

|     |
| --- |
| discount(amount) = amount \* rate(amount); |

In our adaptation, the amount will come from the user and
the rate will come from a database, so there will be two ports. We implement
them in stages:

<!\[if !supportLists\]>·<!\[endif\]>With tests but with a constant rate instead of a
mock database,

<!\[if !supportLists\]>·<!\[endif\]>then with the GUI,

<!\[if !supportLists\]>·<!\[endif\]>then with a mock database that can be swapped
out for a real database.

Thanks to Gyan Sharma at IHC for providing the code for this
example.

Stage 1: FIT + App + constant-as-mock-database

First we create the test cases as an HTML table (see the FIT
documentation for this):

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| TestDiscounter |  |
| amount | discount() |
| 100 | 5 |
| 200 | 10 |

Note that the column names will become class and function
names in our program. FIT contains ways to get rid of this
"programmerese", but for this article it is easier just to leave them
in.

Knowing what the test data will be, we create the user-side
adapter, the ColumnFixture that comes with FIT as shipped:

|     |
| --- |
| import fit.ColumnFixture;<br>public class TestDiscounter extends ColumnFixture <br>{<br>private<br>Discounter app = new Discounter();<br>public double<br>amount;<br>public double discount() {<br>return app.discount(amount);<br>}<br>} |

That's actually all there is to the adapter. So far, the
tests run from the command line (see the FIT book for the path you'll need). We
used this one:

|     |
| --- |
| set<br>FIT\_HOME=/FIT/FitLibraryForFit15Feb2005<br>java<br>-cp<br>%FIT\_HOME%/lib/javaFit1.1b.jar;%FIT\_HOME%/dist/fitLibraryForFit.jar;<br>src;bin<br>fit.FileRunnertest/Discounter.htmlTestDiscount\_Output.html |

FIT produces an output file with colors showing us what
passed (or failed, in case we made a typo somewhere along the way).

At this point the code is ready to check in, hook into
Cruise Control or your automated build machine, and include in the
build-and-test suite.

Stage 2: UI + App + constant-as-mock-database

I'm going to let you create your own UI and have it drive
the Discounter application, since the code is a bit long to include here. Some
of the key lines in the code are these:

|     |
| --- |
| ...<br>Discounter app = new Discounter();<br>public void<br>actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {<br>...String amountStr =<br>text1.getText();<br>double amount =<br>Double.parseDouble(amountStr);<br>discount = app.discount(amount));<br>text3.setText( "" +<br>discount );<br>... |

At this point the application can be both demoed and
regression tested. The user-side adapters are both running.

Stage 3: (FIT or UI) + App + mock database

To create a replaceable adapter for the database side, we
create an _interface_ to a repository,
a _RepositoryFactory_ that will produce
either the mock database or the real service object, and the in-memory mock for
the database.

|     |
| --- |
| public interface RateRepository {<br>double getRate(double amount);<br>} |

|     |
| --- |
| public class RepositoryFactory {<br>public RepositoryFactory() {<br>super(); }<br>public static RateRepository getMockRateRepository() {<br>return new MockRateRepository();<br>}<br>} |

|     |
| --- |
| public class MockRateRepository<br>implements RateRepository {<br>public double getRate(double amount)<br>{<br>if(amount <= 100) return 0.01;<br>if(amount <= 1000) return<br>0.02;<br>return 0.05;<br>}<br>} |

To hook this adapter into the Discounter application, we
need to update the application itself to accept a repository adapter to use,
and the have the (FIT or UI) user-side adapter pass the repository to use (real
or mock) into the constructor of the application itself. Here is the updated
application and a FIT adapter that passes in a mock repository (the FIT adapter
code to choose whether to pass in the mock or real repository's adapter is
longer without adding much new information, so I omit that version here).

|     |
| --- |
| import repository.RepositoryFactory;<br>import repository.RateRepository;<br>public class Discounter {<br>private RateRepository<br>rateRepository;<br>public Discounter(RateRepository r) {<br>super();<br>rateRepository = r;<br>}<br>public double discount(double amount) {<br>double rate =<br>rateRepository.getRate( amount ); <br>return amount \* rate;<br>}<br>} |

|     |
| --- |
| import app.Discounter;<br>import fit.ColumnFixture;<br>public class TestDiscounter extends<br>ColumnFixture {<br>private Discounter app = <br>new<br>Discounter(RepositoryFactory.getMockRateRepository());<br>public double amount;<br>public double discount() {<br>return app.discount( amount );<br>}<br>} |

That concludes implementationof the simplest version of the hexagonal
architecture.

Application Notes

The Left-Right Asymmetry

The ports and adapters pattern is deliberately written
pretending that all ports are fundamentally similar. That pretense is useful at
the architectural level. In implementation, ports and adapters show up in two
flavors, which I'll call _primary_ and _secondary_, for soon-to-be-obvious
reasons. They could be also called _driving_
adapters and _driven_ adapters.

The alert reader will have noticed that in all the examples
given, FIT fixtures are used on the left-side ports and mocks on the right. In
the three-layer architecture, FIT sits in the top layer and the mock sits in
the bottom layer.

This is related to the idea from use cases of "primary
actors" and "secondary actors". A _primary actor_ is an actor that drives the application (takes it out
of quiescent state to perform one of its advertised functions). A _secondary actor_ is one that the
application drives, either to get answers from or to merely notify. The
distinction between _primary_ and _secondary_ lies in who triggers or is in
charge of the conversation.

The natural test adapter to substitute for a _primary_ actor is FIT, since that
framework is designed to read a script and drive the application. The natural
test adapter to substitute for a _secondary_
actor such as a database is a mock, since that is designed to answer queries or
record events from the application.

These observations lead us to follow the system's use case
context diagram and draw the _primary_
_ports_ and _primary adapters_ on the
left side (or top) of the hexagon, and the _secondary_
_ports_ and _secondary adapters_ on
the right (or bottom) side of the hexagon.

The relationship between primary and secondary
ports/adapters and their respective implementation in FIT and mocks is useful
to keep in mind, but it should be used as a consequence of using the ports and
adapters architecture, not to short-circuit it. The ultimate benefit of a ports
and adapters implementation is the ability to run the application in a fully
isolated mode.

Use Cases And The Application Boundary

It is useful to use the hexagonal architecture pattern to
reinforce the preferred way of writing use cases.

A common mistake is to write use cases to contain intimate
knowledge of the technology sitting outside each port. These use cases have
earned a justifiably bad name in the industry for being long, hard-to-read,
boring, brittle, and expensive to maintain.

Understanding the ports and adapters architecture, we can
see that the use cases should generally be written at the application boundary
(the inner hexagon), to specify the functions and events supported by the
application, regardless of external technology. These use cases are shorter,
easier to read, less expensive to maintain, and more stable over time.

How Many Ports?

What exactly a port is and isn't is largely a matter of
taste. At the one extreme, every use case could be given its own port,
producing hundreds of ports for many applications. Alternatively, one could
imagine merging all primary ports and all secondary ports so there are only two
ports, a left side and a right side.

Neither extreme appears optimal.

The weather system described in the Known Uses has four
natural ports: the weather feed, the administrator, the notified subscribers,
the subscriber database. A coffee machine controller has four natural ports:
the user, the database containing the recipes and prices, the dispensers, and
the coin box. A hospital medication system might have three: one for the nurse,
one for the prescription database, and one for the computer-controller
medication dispensers.

It doesn't appear that there is any particular damage in
choosing the "wrong" number of ports, so that remains a matter of
intuition. My selection tends to favor a small number, two, three or four
ports, as described above and in the Known Uses.

Known Uses

<!\[if !vml\]>![](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexFig4.png)<!\[endif\]>

Figure 4

Figure 4 shows an application with four ports and several
adapters at each port. This was derived from an application that listened for
alerts from the national weather service about earthquakes, tornadoes, fires
and floods, and notified people on their telephones or telephone answering
machines. At the time we discussed this system, the system's interfaces were
identified and discussed by _technology,_
_linked to purpose_. There was an interface for trigger-data arriving over a
wire feed, one for notification data to be sent to answering machines, an
administrative interface implemented in a GUI, and a database interface to get
their subscriber data.

The people were struggling because they needed to add an
http interface from the weather service, an email interface to their
subscribers, and they had to find a way to bundle and unbundle their growing
application suite for different customer purchasing preferences. They feared
they were staring at a maintenance and testing nightmare as they had to
implement, test and maintain separate versions for all combinations and
permutations.

Their shift in design was to architect the system's
interfaces _by purpose_ rather than by
technology, and to have the technologies be substitutable (on all sides) by
adapters. They immediately picked up the ability to include the http feed and
the email notification (the new adapters are shown in the drawing with dashed
lines). By making each application executable in headless mode through APIs,
they could add an app-to-add adapter and unbundle the application suite,
connecting the sub-applications on demand. Finally, by making each application
executable completely in isolation, with test and mock adapters in place, they
gained the ability to regression test their applications with stand-alone
automated test scripts.

Mac, Windows, Google,
Flickr, Web 2.0

In the early 1990s, MacIntosh applications such as word
processor applications were required to have API-drivable interfaces, so that
applications and user-written scripts could access all the functions of the
applications. Windows desktop applications have evolved the same ability (I
don't have the historical knowledge to say which came first, nor is that
relevant to the point).

The current (2005) trend in web applications is to publish
an API and let other web applications access those APIs directly. Thus, it is
possible to publish local crime data over a Google map, or create web
applications that include Flickr's photo archiving and annotating abilities.

All of these examples are about making the _primary_ ports' APIs visible. We see no
information here about the secondary ports.

Stored Outputs

This example written by Willem Bogaerts on the C2 wiki:

"I encountered something similar, but mainly because my
application layer had a strong tendency to become a telephone switchboard that
managed things it should not do. My application generated output, showed it to
the user and then had some possibility to store it as well. My main problem was
that you did not need to store it always. So my application generated output,
had to buffer it and present it to the user. Then, when the user decided that
he wanted to store the output, the application retrieved the buffer and stored
it for real.

I did not like this at all. Then I came up with a solution:
Have a presentation control with storage facilities. Now the application no
longer channels the output in different directions, but it simply outputs it to
the presentation control. It's the presentation control that buffers the answer
and gives the user the possibility to store it.

The traditional layered architecture stresses "UI"
and "storage" to be different. The Ports and Adapters Architecture
can reduce output to being simply "output" again. "

Anonymous example from the C2-wiki

"In one project I worked on, we used the SystemMetaphor
of a component stereo system. Each component has defined interfaces, each of
which has a specific purpose. We can then connect components together in almost
unlimited ways using simple cables and adapters."

Distributed, Large-Team Development

This one is still in trial use and so does not properly
count as a use of the pattern. However, it is interesting to consider.

Teams in different locations all build to the Hexagonal
architecture, using FIT and mocks so the applications or components can be
tested in standalone mode. The CruiseControl build runs every half hour and
runs all the applications using the FIT+mock combination. As application
subsystem and databases get completed, the mocks are replaced with test
databases.

Separating Development of UI and Application Logic

This one is still in early trial use and so does not count
as a use of the pattern. However, it is interesting to consider.

The UI design is unstable, as they haven't decided on a
driving technology or a metaphor yet. The back-end services architecture hasn't
been decided, and in fact will probably change several times over the next six
months. Nonetheless, the project has officially started and time is ticking by.

The application team creates FIT tests and mocks to isolate
their application, and creates testable, demonstrable functionality to show
their users. When the UI and back-end services decisions finally get met, it
"should be straightforward" to add those elements the
application.Stay tuned to learn how
this works out (or try it yourself and write me to let me know).

Related Patterns

Adapter

The _Design Patterns_
book contains a description of the generic _Adapter_
pattern: "Convert the interface of a class into another interace clients
expect." The ports-and-adapters pattern is a particular use of the _Adapter_ pattern.

Model-View-Controller

The MVC pattern was implemented as early as 1974 in the
Smalltalk project. It has been given, over the early, many variations, such as
Model-Interactor and Model-View-Presenter. Each of these implements the idea of
ports-and-adapters on the primary ports, not the secondary ports.

Mock Objects and Loopback

"A mock object is a "double agent" used to
test the behaviour of other objects. First, a mock object acts as a faux
implementation of an interface or class that mimics the external behaviour of a
true implementation. Second, a mock object observes how other objects interact
with its methods and compares actual behaviour with preset expectations. When a
discrepancy occurs, a mock object can interrupt the test and report the
anomaly. If the discrepancy cannot be noted during the test, a verification
method called by the tester ensures that all expectations have been met or
failures reported." -- From http://MockObjects.com

Fully miplemented according to the mock-object agenda, mock
objects are used throughout an application, not just at the external interface
The primary thrust of the mock object movement is conformance to specified
protocol at the individual class and object level. I borrow their word
"mock" as the best short description of an in-memory substitute for
an external secondary actor.

The Loopback pattern is an explicit pattern for creating an
internal replacement for an external device.

Pedestals

In "Patterns for Generating a Layered
Architecture", Barry Rubel describes a pattern about creating an axis of
symmetry in control software that is very similar to ports and adapters. The _Pedestal_ pattern calls for implementing
an object representing each hardware device within the system, and linking
those objects together in a control layer. The _Pedestal_ pattern can be used to describe either side of the
hexagonal architecture, but does not yet stress the similarity across adapters.
Also, being written for a mechanical control environment, it is not so easy to
see how to apply the pattern to IT applications.

Checks

Ward Cunningham's pattern language for detecting and
handling user input errors, is good for error handling across the inner hexagon
boundaries.

Dependency Inversion (Dependency Injection) and SPRING

Bob Martin's Dependency Inversion Principle (also called
Dependency Injection by Martin Fowler) states that "High-level modules
should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on
abstractions.Abstractions should not
depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions." The _Dependency Injection_ pattern by Martin
Fowler gives some implementations. These show how to create swappable secondary
actor adapters. The code can be typed in directly, as done in the sample code
in the article, or using configuration files and having the SPRING framework
generate the equivalent code.
