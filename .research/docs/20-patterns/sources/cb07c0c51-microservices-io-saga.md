## Want to learn more about this pattern? [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html\#undefined)

Take a look at my [self-paced, online bootcamp](https://chrisrichardson.net/virtual-bootcamp-distributed-data-management.html) that teaches you how to use the Saga, API Composition, and CQRS patterns to design operations that span multiple services.

## Context [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html\#context)

You have applied the [Database per Service](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html) pattern.
Each service has its own database.
Some business transactions, however, span multiple service so you need a mechanism to implement transactions that span services.
For example, let’s imagine that you are building an e-commerce store where customers have a credit limit.
The application must ensure that a new order will not exceed the customer’s credit limit.
Since Orders and Customers are in different databases owned by different services the application cannot simply use a local ACID transaction.

## Problem [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html\#problem)

How to implement transactions that span services?

## Forces [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html\#forces)

- 2PC is not an option

## Solution [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html\#solution)

Implement each business transaction that spans multiple services as a saga.
A saga is a sequence of local transactions.
Each local transaction updates the database and publishes a message or event to trigger the next local transaction in the saga.
If a local transaction fails because it violates a business rule then the saga executes a series of compensating transactions that undo the changes that were made by the preceding local transactions.

![](https://microservices.io/i/sagas/From_2PC_To_Saga.png)

There are two ways of coordination sagas:

- Choreography - each local transaction publishes domain events that trigger local transactions in other services
- Orchestration - an orchestrator (object) tells the participants what local transactions to execute

## Example: Choreography-based saga [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html\#example-choreography-based-saga)

![](https://microservices.io/i/sagas/Create_Order_Saga.png)

An e-commerce application that uses this approach would create an order using a choreography-based saga that consists of the following steps:

1. The `Order Service` receives the `POST /orders` request and creates an `Order` in a `PENDING` state
2. It then emits an `Order Created` event
3. The `Customer Service`’s event handler attempts to reserve credit
4. It then emits an event indicating the outcome
5. The `OrderService`’s event handler either approves or rejects the `Order`

## Example: Orchestration-based saga [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html\#example-orchestration-based-saga)

![](https://microservices.io/i/sagas/Create_Order_Saga_Orchestration.png)

An e-commerce application that uses this approach would create an order using an orchestration-based saga that consists of the following steps:

1. The `Order Service` receives the `POST /orders` request and creates the `Create Order` saga orchestrator
2. The saga orchestrator creates an `Order` in the `PENDING` state
3. It then sends a `Reserve Credit` command to the `Customer Service`
4. The `Customer Service` attempts to reserve credit
5. It then sends back a reply message indicating the outcome
6. The saga orchestrator either approves or rejects the `Order`

## Resulting context [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html\#resulting-context)

This pattern has the following benefits:

- It enables an application to maintain data consistency across multiple services without using distributed transactions

This solution has the following drawbacks:

- Lack of automatic rollback - a developer must design compensating transactions that explicitly undo changes made earlier in a saga rather than relying on the automatic rollback feature of ACID transactions

- Lack of isolation (the “I” in ACID) - the lack of isolation means that there’s risk that the concurrent execution of multiple sagas and transactions can use data anomalies. consequently, a saga developer must typical use countermeasures, which are design techniques that implement isolation. Moreover, careful analysis is needed to select and correctly implement the countermeasures. See [Chapter 4/section 4.3 of my book Microservices Patterns](https://livebook.manning.com/book/microservices-patterns/chapter-4/143) for more information.


There are also the following issues to address:

- In order to be reliable, a service must atomically update its database _and_ publish a message/event.
It cannot use the traditional mechanism of a distributed transaction that spans the database and the message broker.
Instead, it must use one of the patterns listed below.

- A client that initiates the saga, which an asynchronous flow, using a synchronous request (e.g. HTTP `POST /orders`) needs to be able to determine its outcome.
There are several options, each with different trade-offs:
  - The service sends back a response once the saga completes, e.g. once it receives an `OrderApproved` or `OrderRejected` event.
  - The service sends back a response (e.g. containing the `orderID`) after initiating the saga and the client periodically polls (e.g. `GET /orders/{orderID}`) to determine the outcome
  - The service sends back a response (e.g. containing the `orderID`) after initiating the saga, and then sends an event (e.g. websocket, web hook, etc) to the client once the saga completes.

## Related patterns [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html\#related-patterns)

- The [Database per Service pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html) creates the need for this pattern
- The following patterns are ways to _atomically_ update state _and_ publish messages/events:

  - [Event sourcing](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html)
  - [Transactional Outbox](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html)
- A choreography-based saga can publish events using [Aggregates](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/aggregate.html) and [Domain Events](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/domain-event.html)
- The [Command-side replica](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/command-side-replica.html) is an alternative pattern, which can replace saga step that query data

- [Orchestration-based saga](https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-sagas-examples-customers-and-orders) where the `Order Service` uses a saga orchestrator implemented using the [Eventuate Tram Sagas framework](https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-sagas)
- [Choreography and event sourcing-based saga](https://github.com/eventuate-examples/eventuate-examples-java-customers-and-orders) where the services publish domain events using the [Eventuate event sourcing framework](http://eventuate.io/)
