## Context [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/api-composition.html\#context)

You have applied the [Microservices architecture pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html) and the [Database per service pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html).
As a result, it is no longer straightforward to implement queries that join data from multiple services.

## Problem [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/api-composition.html\#problem)

How to implement queries in a microservice architecture?

## Solution [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/api-composition.html\#solution)

Implement a query by defining an _API Composer_, which invoking the services that own the data and performs an in-memory join of the results.

![](https://microservices.io/i/data/ApiBasedQueryBigPicture.png)

## Example [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/api-composition.html\#example)

An [API Gateway](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html) often does API composition.

## Resulting context [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/api-composition.html\#resulting-context)

This pattern has the following benefits:

- It a simple way to query data in a microservice architecture

This pattern has the following drawbacks:

- Some queries would result in inefficient, in-memory joins of large datasets.

## Related patterns [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/api-composition.html\#related-patterns)

- The [Database per Service pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html) creates the need for this pattern
- The [CQRS pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html) is an alternative solution
