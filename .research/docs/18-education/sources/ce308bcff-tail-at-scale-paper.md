Software techniques that tolerate latency
variability are vital to building responsive
large-scale Web services.

The Tail
at Scale

Sy stem s that resp ond to user actions quickly (within
100ms) feel more fluid and natural to users than
3
those that take longer. Improvements in Internet
connectivity and the rise of warehouse-scale computing
systems2 have enabled Web services that provide fluid
responsiveness while consulting multi-terabyte datasets
spanning thousands of servers; for example, the Google
search system updates query results interactively as
the user types, predicting the most likely query based
on the prefix typed so far, performing the search and
showing the results within a few tens of milliseconds.
Emerging augmented-reality devices (such as the
7
Google Glass prototype) will need associated Web
services with even greater responsiveness in order to
guarantee seamless interactivity.
It is challenging for service providers to keep the tail

It is challenging for service providers to keep the tail
of latency distribution short for interactive services
as the size and complexity of the system scales up or

as overall use increases. Temporary
high-latency episodes (unimportant in
moderate-size systems) may come to
dominate overall service performance at
large scale. Just as fault-tolerant computing aims to create a reliable whole out of
é Barrless-reliable parts, large online services
need to create a predictably responsive
whole out of less-predictable parts;
we refer to such systems as “latency
tail-tolerant,” or simply “tail-tolerant.”
Here, we outline some common causes
for high-latency episodes in large online
services and describe techniques that
reduce their severity or mitigate their
effect on whole-system performance.
In many cases, tail-tolerant techniques
can take advantage of resources already
deployed to achieve fault-tolerance, resulting in low additional overhead. We
explore how these techniques allow system utilization to be driven higher without lengthening the latency tail, thus
avoiding wasteful overprovisioning.

A common technique for reducing latency in large-scale online services is to
parallelize sub-operations across many
different machines, where each sub-operation is co-located with its portion of
a large dataset. Parallelization happens
by fanning out a request from a root to
a large number of leaf servers and merging responses via a request-distribution
tree. These sub-operations must all
complete within a strict deadline for the
service to feel responsive.

Reducing head-of-line blocking. Highlevel services can handle requests with
widely varying intrinsic costs. It is sometimes useful for the system to break
long-running requests into a sequence
of smaller requests to allow interleaving
of the execution of other short-running
requests; for example, Google’s Web
search system uses such time-slicing to
prevent a small number of very computationally expensive queries from adding substantial latency to a large number of concurrent cheaper queries.

Managing background activities and

tasks can create significant CPU, disk,
or network load; examples are log
compaction in log-oriented storage
systems and garbage-collector activity
in garbage-collected languages. A combination of throttling, breaking down
heavyweight operations into smaller
operations, and triggering such operations at times of lower overall load is
often able to reduce the effect of background activities on interactive request
latency. For large fan-out services, it is
sometimes useful for the system to synchronize the background activity across
many different machines. This synchronization enforces a brief burst of activity
on each machine simultaneously, slowing only those interactive requests being
handled during the brief period of background activity. In contrast, without synchronization, a few machines are always
doing some background activity, pushing out the latency tail on all requests.

systems with shared computational request has been outstanding for more
resources exhibit performance fluctuations beyond the control of application
developers. Google has therefore found
it advantageous to develop tail-tolerant
techniques that mask or work around
temporary latency pathologies, instead
of trying to eliminate them altogether.
We separate these techniques into two
main classes: The first corresponds to
within-request immediate-response
techniques that operate at a time scale
of tens of milliseconds, before longerterm techniques have a chance to react.
The second consists of cross-request
long-term adaptations that perform on
a time scale of tens of seconds to minutes and are meant to mask the effect of
longer-term phenomena.

multiple replicas of data items to provide additional throughput capacity and
maintain availability in the presence of
failures. This approach is particularly
effective when most requests operate on
largely read-only, loosely consistent datasets; an example is a spelling-correction service that has its model updated
once a day while handling thousands of
correction requests per second. Similarly, distributed file systems may have
multiple replicas of a given data chunk
that can all be used to service read requests. The techniques here show how
replication can also be used to reduce
latency variability within a single higher-level request:

Hedged requests. A simple way to
curb latency variability is to issue the
same request to multiple replicas and
use the results from whichever replica
responds first. We term such requests
“hedged requests” because a client first
sends one request to the replica believed to be the most appropriate, but
then falls back on sending a secondary
request after some brief delay. The client cancels remaining outstanding requests once the first result is received.
Although naive implementations of
this technique typically add unacceptable additional load, many variations
exist that give most of the latency-reduction effects while increasing load
only modestly.
One such approach is to defer send-

tency for this class of requests. This
approach limits the additional load to
approximately 5% while substantially

There is a brief window of one average network message delay where both

is if both server queues are completely
empty. It is useful therefore for the client to introduce a small delay of two

networks) between sending the first request and sending the second request.

technique in the context of its clusterlevel distributed file system is effective
at reducing both median and tail latencies. Table 2 lists the times for servicing
a small read request from a BigTable
where the data is not cached in memory
but must be read from the underlying
file system; each file chunk has three
replicas on distinct machines. The table
includes read latencies observed with
and without tied requests for two scenarios: The first is a cluster in which the
benchmark is running in isolation, in
which case latency variability is mostly

from self-interference and regular cluster-management activities. In it, sending a tied request that does cross-server
cancellation to another file system and forwarded to replicas only if the inireplica following 1ms reduces median
latency by 16% and is increasingly effective along the tail of the latency distribution, achieving nearly 40% reducth
tion at the 99.9-percentile latency. The
second scenario is like the first except
there is also a large, concurrent sorting
job running on the same cluster contending for the same disk resources in
the shared file system. Although overall
latencies are somewhat higher due to
higher utilization, similar reductions in
the latency profile are achieved with the
tied-request technique discussed earlier. The latency profile with tied requests
while running a concurrent large sorting job is nearly identical to the latency
profile of a mostly idle cluster without
tied requests. Tied requests allow the
workloads to be consolidated into a single cluster, resulting in dramatic computing cost reductions. In both Table 2
scenarios, the overhead of tied requests
in disk utilization is less than 1%, indicating the cancellation strategy is effec-

Worth noting is this technique is not

also applicable in more-complex coding
schemes (such as Reed-Solomon) where
a primary request is sent to the machine
with the desired data block, and, if no
response is received following a brief
delay, a collection of requests is issued
to a subset of the remaining replication group sufficient to reconstruct the
desired data, with the whole ensemble

uncorrelated phenomena are rather
common in large-scale systems.

Long-Term A daptations
Here, we turn to techniques that are applicable for reducing latency variability
caused by coarser-grain phenomena
(such as service-time variations and
load imbalance). Although many systems try to partition data in such a way
that the partitions have equal cost, a
static assignment of a single partition
to each machine is rarely sufficient in
practice for two reasons: First, the performance of the underlying machines
is neither uniform nor constant over
time, for reasons (such as thermal
throttling and shared workload interference) mentioned earlier. And second,
outliers in the assignment of items to
partitions can cause data-induced load
imbalance (such as when a particular
item becomes popular and the load for
its partition increases).
Micro-partitions. To combat imbal- th
in 1/20 the time it would take if the system simply had a one-to-one mapping
of partitions to machines. The BigTable
distributed-storage system stores data
in tablets, with each machine managing
between 20 and 1,000 tablets at a time.
Failure-recovery speed is also improved
through micro-partitioning, since many
machines pick up one unit of work when
a machine failure occurs. This method
of using micro-partitions is similar to
the virtual servers notion as described
in Stoica12 and the virtual-processor-

partitioning technique in DeWitt et al.
Selective replication. An enhancement of the micro-partitioning scheme
is to detect or even predict certain items
that are likely to cause load imbalance
and create additional replicas of these
items. Load-balancing systems can then
use the additional replicas to spread
the load of these hot micro-partitions
across multiple machines without having to actually move micro-partitions.
Google’s main Web search system uses
this approach, making additional copies of popular and important documents in multiple micro-partitions. At
various times in Google’s Web search
system’s evolution, it has also created
micro-partitions biased toward particular document languages and adjusted
replication of these micro-partitions
as the mix of query languages changes
through the course of a typical day.
Query mixes can also change abruptly,
as when, say, an Asian data-center outage causes a large fraction of Asian-language queries to be directed to a North
American facility, materially changing
its workload behavior.

Retrieval Systems
In large information-retrieval (IR) sys-

In large information-retrieval (IR) systems, speed is more than a performance
metric; it is a key quality metric, as returning good results quickly is better
than returning the best results slowly.
Two techniques apply to such systems,
as well as other to systems that inherently deal with imprecise results:
Good enough. In large IR systems,

ently deal with imprecise results:
Good enough. In large IR systems,
once a sufficient fraction of all the leaf
servers has responded, the user may
be best served by being given slightly
incomplete (“good-enough”) results in
exchange for better end-to-end latency.
The chance that a particular leaf server
has the best result for the query is less
than one in 1,000 queries, odds further
reduced by replicating the most important documents in the corpus into
multiple leaf servers. Since waiting for
exceedingly slow servers might stretch
service latency to unacceptable levels,
Google’s IR systems are tuned to occasionally respond with good-enough results when an acceptable fraction of the
overall corpus has been searched, while
being careful to ensure good-enough
results remain rare. In general, goodenough schemes are also used to skip
nonessential subsystems to improve responsiveness; for example, results from
ads or spelling-correction systems are
easily skipped for Web searches if they
do not respond in time.
Canary requests. Another problem

do not respond in time.
Canary requests. Another problem
that can occur in systems with very high
fan-out is that a particular request exercises an untested code path, causing
crashes or extremely long delays on
thousands of servers simultaneously. To
prevent such correlated crash scenarios,
some of Google’s IR systems employ
a technique called “canary requests”;
rather than initially send a request to
thousands of leaf servers, a root server
sends it first to one or two leaf servers.
The remaining servers are only queried
if the root gets a successful response
from the canary in a reasonable period
of time. If the server crashes or hangs
while the canary request is outstanding,
the system flags the request as potentially dangerous and prevents further ex- ecution by not sending it to the remaining leaf servers. Canary requests provide
a measure of robustness to back-ends in
the face of difficult-to-predict programming errors, as well as malicious denialof-service attacks.
The canary-request phase adds only a

of-service attacks.
The canary-request phase adds only a
small amount of overall latency because
the system must wait for only a single
server to respond, producing much less
variability than if it had to wait for all
servers to respond for large fan-out requests; compare the first and last rows
in Table 1. Despite the slight increase
in latency caused by canary requests,
such requests tend to be used for every
request in all of Google’s large fan-out
search systems due to the additional
safety they provide.

M utations
The techniques we have discussed so
far are most applicable for operations
that do not perform critical mutations
of the system’s state, which covers a
broad range of data-intensive services.
Tolerating latency variability for operations that mutate state is somewhat easier for a number of reasons: First, the
scale of latency-critical modifications
in these services is generally small. Second, updates can often be performed
off the critical path, after responding
to the user. Third, many services can
be structured to tolerate inconsistent
update models for (inherently more
latency-tolerant) mutations. And, finally, for those services that require consistent updates, the most commonly
used techniques are quorum-based
algorithms (such as Lamport’s Paxos8);
since these algorithms must commit to
only three to five replicas, they are inherently tail-tolerant.

H ardware Trends and Their E ffects
Variability at the hardware level is likely
to be higher in the future due to more
aggressive power optimizations becoming available and fabrication challenges
at deep submicron levels resulting in
device-level heterogeneity. Device heterogeneity combined with ever-increasing system scale will make tolerating
variability through software techniques
even more important over time. Fortunately, several emerging hardware
trends will increase the effectiveness
of latency-tolerating techniques. For
example, higher bisection bandwidth

in data-center networks and networkinterface optimizations that reduce make it possible to achieve higher sysper-message overheads (such as remote
direct-memory access) will reduce the
cost of tied requests, making it more
likely that cancellation messages are received in time to avoid redundant work.

C onclusion
Delivering the next generation of compute-intensive, seamlessly interactive
cloud services requires consistently
responsive massive-scale computing
systems that are only now beginning to
be contemplated. As systems scale up,
simply stamping out all sources of performance variability will not achieve
such responsiveness. Fault-tolerant
techniques were developed because
guaranteeing fault-free operation became infeasible beyond certain levels
of system complexity. Similarly, tailtolerant techniques are being developed for large-scale services because
eliminating all sources of variability is
also infeasible. Although approaches
that address particular sources of latency variability are useful, the most
powerful tail-tolerant techniques reduce latency hiccups regardless of
root cause. These tail-tolerant techniques allow designers to continue to
optimize for the common case while
providing resilience against uncommon cases. We have outlined a small

that have been effective in several of
