# Catalog of Patterns of Distributed Systems

[Unmesh Joshi](https://twitter.com/unmeshjoshi) [![](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/index/uj.jpg)](https://twitter.com/unmeshjoshi)

23 November 2023

Distributed systems provide a particular challenge to program. They
often require us to have multiple copies of data, which need to keep
synchronized. Yet we cannot rely on processing nodes working reliably, and
network delays can easily lead to inconsistencies. Despite this, many
organizations rely on a range of core distributed software handling data
storage, messaging, system management, and compute capability. These
systems face common problems which they solve with similar solutions.

In 2020 I began collecting these solutions as patterns, publishing them
on this site as I developed them. In 2023 these were published in the book
[Patterns of Distributed\\
Systems](https://martinfowler.com/books/patterns-distributed.html). On this site I now have short summaries of each pattern, with
deep links to the relevant chapters for the online eBook publication on
oreilly.com (marked on this page with [![](https://martinfowler.com/external.svg)).](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/patterns-of-distributed/9780138222246)
