# Lease

Use time-bound leases for cluster nodes to coordinate their activities.

## Problem

Cluster nodes need exclusive access to certain resources.
But nodes can crash, be temporarily disconnected, or experience a process pause.
Under these error scenarios, they should not keep the access to a resource indefinitely.


## Solution

A cluster node can ask for a lease for a limited period of time, after which it expires.
The node can renew the lease before it expires if it wants to extend the access.
Implement the lease mechanism with [Consistent Core](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/consistent-core.html) to provide fault tolerance
and consistency. Have a time-to-live value associated with the lease.
Cluster nodes can create keys in a consistent core with a lease attached to it.


It's the responsibility of the node that owns the lease to periodically refresh it.
[HeartBeat](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/heartbeat.html) is used by clients to refresh the time-to-live value in the consistent core.
