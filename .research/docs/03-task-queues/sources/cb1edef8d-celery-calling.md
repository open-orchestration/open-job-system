## [Basics](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#id1) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#basics "Link to this heading")

This document describes Celery’s uniform “Calling API”
used by task instances and the [canvas](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/canvas.html#guide-canvas).

The API defines a standard set of execution options, as well as three methods:

> - `apply_async(args[, kwargs[, …]])`
>
>
> > Sends a task message.
>
> - `delay(*args, **kwargs)`
>
>
> > Shortcut to send a task message, but doesn’t support execution
> > options.
>
> - _calling_ (`__call__`)
>
>
> > Applying an object supporting the calling API (e.g., `add(2, 2)`)
> > means that the task will not be executed by a worker, but in the current
> > process instead (a message won’t be sent).

Quick Cheat Sheet

- `T.delay(arg, kwarg=value)`

Star arguments shortcut to `.apply_async`.
(`.delay(*args, **kwargs)` calls `.apply_async(args, kwargs)`).

- `T.apply_async((arg,), {'kwarg': value})`

- `T.apply_async(countdown=10)`

executes in 10 seconds from now.

- `T.apply_async(eta=now + timedelta(seconds=10))`

executes in 10 seconds from now, specified using `eta`

- `T.apply_async(countdown=60, expires=120)`

executes in one minute from now, but expires after 2 minutes.

- `T.apply_async(expires=now + timedelta(days=2))`

expires in 2 days, set using [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime "(in Python v3.15)").

- `T.apply_async(task_id=f'my_own_task_id')`

sets the id of the task to my\_own\_task\_id instead of a uuid that is normally generated


### Example [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#example "Link to this heading")

The [`delay()`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/celery.app.task.html#celery.app.task.Task.delay "celery.app.task.Task.delay") method is convenient as it looks like calling a regular
function:

```
task.delay(arg1, arg2, kwarg1='x', kwarg2='y')
```

Using [`apply_async()`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/celery.app.task.html#celery.app.task.Task.apply_async "celery.app.task.Task.apply_async") instead you have to write:

```
task.apply_async(args=[arg1, arg2], kwargs={'kwarg1': 'x', 'kwarg2': 'y'})
```

Tip

If the task isn’t registered in the current process
you can use [`send_task()`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/celery.html#celery.Celery.send_task "celery.Celery.send_task") to call the task by name instead.

So delay is clearly convenient, but if you want to set additional execution
options you have to use `apply_async`.

The rest of this document will go into the task execution
options in detail. All examples use a task
called add, returning the sum of two arguments:

```
@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

There’s another way…

You’ll learn more about this later while reading about the [Canvas](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/canvas.html#guide-canvas), but [`signature`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/celery.html#celery.signature "celery.signature")’s are objects used to pass around
the signature of a task invocation, (for example to send it over the
network), and they also support the Calling API:

```
task.s(arg1, arg2, kwarg1='x', kwargs2='y').apply_async()
```

## [Linking (callbacks/errbacks)](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#id2) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#linking-callbacks-errbacks "Link to this heading")

Celery supports linking tasks together so that one task follows another.
The callback task will be applied with the result of the parent task
as a partial argument:

```
add.apply_async((2, 2), link=add.s(16))
```

What’s `s`?

The `add.s` call used here is called a signature. If you
don’t know what they are you should read about them in the
[canvas guide](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/canvas.html#guide-canvas).
There you can also learn about [`chain`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/celery.html#celery.chain "celery.chain"): a simpler
way to chain tasks together.

In practice the `link` execution option is considered an internal
primitive, and you’ll probably not use it directly, but
use chains instead.

Here the result of the first task (4) will be sent to a new
task that adds 16 to the previous result, forming the expression
![(2 + 2) + 16 = 20](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/_images/math/5121aa6410cb52f2ef7c903f90d70d8f3e7c365e.png)

You can also cause a callback to be applied if task raises an exception
( _errback_). The worker won’t actually call the errback as a task, but will
instead call the errback function directly so that the raw request, exception
and traceback objects can be passed to it.

This is an example error callback:

```
@app.task
def error_handler(request, exc, traceback):
    print('Task {0} raised exception: {1!r}\n{2!r}'.format(
          request.id, exc, traceback))
```

it can be added to the task using the `link_error` execution
option:

```
add.apply_async((2, 2), link_error=error_handler.s())
```

In addition, both the `link` and `link_error` options can be expressed
as a list:

```
add.apply_async((2, 2), link=[add.s(16), other_task.s()])
```

The callbacks/errbacks will then be called in order, and all
callbacks will be called with the return value of the parent task
as a partial argument.

In the case of a chord, we can handle errors using multiple handling strategies.
See [chord error handling](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/canvas.html#chord-errors) for more information.

## [On message](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#id3) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#on-message "Link to this heading")

Celery supports catching all states changes by setting on\_message callback.

For example for long-running tasks to send task progress you can do something like this:

```
@app.task(bind=True)
def hello(self, a, b):
    time.sleep(1)
    self.update_state(state="PROGRESS", meta={'progress': 50})
    time.sleep(1)
    self.update_state(state="PROGRESS", meta={'progress': 90})
    time.sleep(1)
    return 'hello world: %i' % (a+b)
```

```
def on_raw_message(body):
    print(body)

a, b = 1, 1
r = hello.apply_async(args=(a, b))
print(r.get(on_message=on_raw_message, propagate=False))
```

Will generate output like this:

```
{'task_id': '5660d3a3-92b8-40df-8ccc-33a5d1d680d7',
 'result': {'progress': 50},
 'children': [],
 'status': 'PROGRESS',
 'traceback': None}
{'task_id': '5660d3a3-92b8-40df-8ccc-33a5d1d680d7',
 'result': {'progress': 90},
 'children': [],
 'status': 'PROGRESS',
 'traceback': None}
{'task_id': '5660d3a3-92b8-40df-8ccc-33a5d1d680d7',
 'result': 'hello world: 10',
 'children': [],
 'status': 'SUCCESS',
 'traceback': None}
hello world: 10
```

## [ETA and Countdown](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#id4) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#eta-and-countdown "Link to this heading")

The ETA (estimated time of arrival) lets you set a specific date and time that
is the earliest time at which your task will be executed. countdown is
a shortcut to set ETA by seconds into the future.

```
>>> result = add.apply_async((2, 2), countdown=3)
>>> result.get()    # this takes at least 3 seconds to return
4
```

The task is guaranteed to be executed at some time _after_ the
specified date and time, but not necessarily at that exact time.
Possible reasons for broken deadlines may include many items waiting
in the queue, or heavy network latency. To make sure your tasks
are executed in a timely manner you should monitor the queue for congestion. Use
Munin, or similar tools, to receive alerts, so appropriate action can be
taken to ease the workload. See [Munin](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring-munin).

While countdown is an integer, eta must be a [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime "(in Python v3.15)")
object, specifying an exact date and time (including millisecond precision,
and timezone information):

```
>>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

>>> tomorrow = datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(days=1)
>>> add.apply_async((2, 2), eta=tomorrow)
```

Warning

Tasks with eta or countdown are immediately fetched by the worker
and until the scheduled time passes, they reside in the worker’s memory.
When using those options to schedule lots of tasks for a distant future,
those tasks may accumulate in the worker and make a significant impact on
the RAM usage.

Moreover, tasks are not acknowledged until the worker starts executing
them. If using Redis as a broker, task will get redelivered when countdown
exceeds visibility\_timeout (see [Caveats](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/redis.html#redis-caveats)).

Therefore, using eta and countdown **is not recommended** for
scheduling tasks for a distant future. Ideally, use values no longer
than several minutes. For longer durations, consider using
database-backed periodic tasks, e.g. with [https://pypi.org/project/django-celery-beat/](https://pypi.org/project/django-celery-beat/) if
using Django (see [Using custom scheduler classes](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html#beat-custom-schedulers)).

Warning

When using RabbitMQ as a message broker when specifying a `countdown`
over 15 minutes, you may encounter the problem that the worker terminates
with an [`PreconditionFailed`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/projects/amqp/en/latest/reference/amqp.exceptions.html#amqp.exceptions.PreconditionFailed "(in py-amqp v5.3)") error will be raised:

```
amqp.exceptions.PreconditionFailed: (0, 0): (406) PRECONDITION_FAILED - consumer ack timed out on channel
```

In RabbitMQ since version 3.8.15 the default value for
`consumer_timeout` is 15 minutes.
Since version 3.8.17 it was increased to 30 minutes. If a consumer does
not ack its delivery for more than the timeout value, its channel will be
closed with a `PRECONDITION_FAILED` channel exception.
See [Delivery Acknowledgement Timeout](https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumers.html#acknowledgement-timeout) for more information.

To solve the problem, in RabbitMQ configuration file `rabbitmq.conf` you
should specify the `consumer_timeout` parameter greater than or equal to
your countdown value. For example, you can specify a very large value
of `consumer_timeout = 31622400000`, which is equal to 1 year
in milliseconds, to avoid problems in the future.

## [Expiration](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#id5) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#expiration "Link to this heading")

The expires argument defines an optional expiry time,
either as seconds after task publish, or a specific date and time using
[`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime "(in Python v3.15)"):

```
>>> # Task expires after one minute from now.
>>> add.apply_async((10, 10), expires=60)

>>> # Also supports datetime
>>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
>>> add.apply_async((10, 10), kwargs,
...                 expires=datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(days=1))
```

When a worker receives an expired task it will mark
the task as [`REVOKED`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/tasks.html#std-state-REVOKED) ( [`TaskRevokedError`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/celery.exceptions.html#celery.exceptions.TaskRevokedError "celery.exceptions.TaskRevokedError")).

## [Message Sending Retry](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#id6) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#message-sending-retry "Link to this heading")

Celery will automatically retry sending messages in the event of connection
failure, and retry behavior can be configured – like how often to retry, or a maximum
number of retries – or disabled all together.

To disable retry you can set the `retry` execution option to `False`:

```
add.apply_async((2, 2), retry=False)
```

| - [`task_publish_retry`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-task_publish_retry) | - [`task_publish_retry_policy`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-task_publish_retry_policy) |

### Retry Policy [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#retry-policy "Link to this heading")

A retry policy is a mapping that controls how retries behave,
and can contain the following keys:

- max\_retries


> Maximum number of retries before giving up, in this case the
> exception that caused the retry to fail will be raised.
>
> A value of `None` means it will retry forever.
>
> The default is to retry 3 times.

- interval\_start


> Defines the number of seconds (float or integer) to wait between
> retries. Default is 0 (the first retry will be instantaneous).

- interval\_step


> On each consecutive retry this number will be added to the retry
> delay (float or integer). Default is 0.2.

- interval\_max


> Maximum number of seconds (float or integer) to wait between
> retries. Default is 0.2.

- retry\_errors


> retry\_errors is a tuple of exception classes that should be retried.
> It will be ignored if not specified. Default is None (ignored).
>
> For example, if you want to retry only tasks that were timed out, you can use
> [`TimeoutError`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/projects/kombu/en/main/reference/kombu.exceptions.html#kombu.exceptions.TimeoutError "(in Kombu v5.6)"):
>
> ```
> from kombu.exceptions import TimeoutError
>
> add.apply_async((2, 2), retry=True, retry_policy={
>     'max_retries': 3,
>     'retry_errors': (TimeoutError, ),
> })
> ```
>
> Added in version 5.3.


For example, the default policy correlates to:

```
add.apply_async((2, 2), retry=True, retry_policy={
    'max_retries': 3,
    'interval_start': 0,
    'interval_step': 0.2,
    'interval_max': 0.2,
    'retry_errors': None,
})
```

the maximum time spent retrying will be 0.4 seconds. It’s set relatively
short by default because a connection failure could lead to a retry pile effect
if the broker connection is down – For example, many web server processes waiting
to retry, blocking other incoming requests.

## [Connection Error Handling](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#id7) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#connection-error-handling "Link to this heading")

When you send a task and the message transport connection is lost, or
the connection cannot be initiated, an [`OperationalError`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/celery.exceptions.html#celery.exceptions.OperationalError "kombu.exceptions.OperationalError")
error will be raised:

```
>>> from proj.tasks import add
>>> add.delay(2, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "celery/app/task.py", line 388, in delay
        return self.apply_async(args, kwargs)
  File "celery/app/task.py", line 503, in apply_async
    **options
  File "celery/app/base.py", line 662, in send_task
    amqp.send_task_message(P, name, message, **options)
  File "celery/backends/rpc.py", line 275, in on_task_call
    maybe_declare(self.binding(producer.channel), retry=True)
  File "/opt/celery/kombu/kombu/messaging.py", line 204, in _get_channel
    channel = self._channel = channel()
  File "/opt/celery/py-amqp/amqp/connection.py", line 272, in connect
    self.transport.connect()
  File "/opt/celery/py-amqp/amqp/transport.py", line 100, in connect
    self._connect(self.host, self.port, self.connect_timeout)
  File "/opt/celery/py-amqp/amqp/transport.py", line 141, in _connect
    self.sock.connect(sa)
  kombu.exceptions.OperationalError: [Errno 61] Connection refused
```

If you have [retries](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html#calling-retry) enabled this will only happen after
retries are exhausted, or when disabled immediately.

You can handle this error too:

```
>>> from celery.utils.log import get_logger
>>> logger = get_logger(__name__)

>>> try:
...     add.delay(2, 2)
... except add.OperationalError as exc:
...     logger.exception('Sending task raised: %r', exc)
```

Note

With RabbitMQ, these errors only indicate the broker is unreachable.
Messages can still be silently dropped when the broker hits resource
limits. Enable `confirm_publish` in [`broker_transport_options`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-broker_transport_options)
to detect this.

## [Serializers](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#id8) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#serializers "Link to this heading")

Security

The pickle module allows for execution of arbitrary functions,
please see the [security guide](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/security.html#guide-security).

Celery also comes with a special serializer that uses
cryptography to sign your messages.

Data transferred between clients and workers needs to be serialized,
so every message in Celery has a `content_type` header that
describes the serialization method used to encode it.

The default serializer is JSON, but you can
change this using the [`task_serializer`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-task_serializer) setting,
or for each individual task, or even per message.

There’s built-in support for JSON, [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "(in Python v3.15)"), YAML
and `msgpack`, and you can also add your own custom serializers by registering
them into the Kombu serializer registry

See also

[Message Serialization](https://docs.celeryq.dev/projects/kombu/en/main/userguide/serialization.html#guide-serialization "(in Kombu v5.6)") in the Kombu user
guide.

Each option has its advantages and disadvantages.

json – JSON is supported in many programming languages, is now

a standard part of Python (since 2.6), and is fairly fast to decode.

The primary disadvantage to JSON is that it limits you to the following
data types: strings, Unicode, floats, Boolean, dictionaries, and lists.
Decimals and dates are notably missing.

Binary data will be transferred using Base64 encoding,
increasing the size of the transferred data by 34% compared to an encoding
format where native binary types are supported.

However, if your data fits inside the above constraints and you need
cross-language support, the default setting of JSON is probably your
best choice.

See [http://json.org](http://json.org/) for more information.

Note

(From Python official docs [https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/json.html](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/json.html))
Keys in key/value pairs of JSON are always of the type [`str`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/stdtypes.html#str "(in Python v3.15)"). When
a dictionary is converted into JSON, all the keys of the dictionary are
coerced to strings. As a result of this, if a dictionary is converted
into JSON and then back into a dictionary, the dictionary may not equal
the original one. That is, `loads(dumps(x)) != x` if x has non-string
keys.

Warning

With more complex workflows created using [Canvas: Designing Work-flows](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/canvas.html#guide-canvas), the JSON
serializer has been observed to drastically inflate message sizes due to
recursive references, leading to resource issues. The _pickle_ serializer
is not vulnerable to this and may therefore be preferable in such cases.

pickle – If you have no desire to support any language other than

Python, then using the pickle encoding will gain you the support of
all built-in Python data types (except class instances), smaller
messages when sending binary files, and a slight speedup over JSON
processing.

See [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "(in Python v3.15)") for more information.

yaml – YAML has many of the same characteristics as json,

except that it natively supports more data types (including dates,
recursive references, etc.).

However, the Python libraries for YAML are a good bit slower than the
libraries for JSON.

If you need a more expressive set of data types and need to maintain
cross-language compatibility, then YAML may be a better fit than the above.

To use it, install Celery with:

```
$ pip install celery[yaml]
```

See [http://yaml.org/](http://yaml.org/) for more information.

msgpack – msgpack is a binary serialization format that’s closer to JSON

in features. The format compresses better, so is a faster to parse and
encode compared to JSON.

To use it, install Celery with:

```
$ pip install celery[msgpack]
```

See [http://msgpack.org/](http://msgpack.org/) for more information.

To use a custom serializer you need to add the content type to
[`accept_content`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-accept_content). By default, only JSON is accepted,
and tasks containing other content headers are rejected.

The following order is used to decide the serializer
used when sending a task:

> 1. The serializer execution option.
>
> 2. The [`Task.serializer`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/celery.app.task.html#celery.app.task.Task.serializer "celery.app.task.Task.serializer") attribute
>
> 3. The [`task_serializer`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-task_serializer) setting.

Example setting a custom serializer for a single task invocation:

```
>>> add.apply_async((10, 10), serializer='json')
```

## [Compression](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#id9) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#compression "Link to this heading")

Celery can compress messages using the following builtin schemes:

- brotli


> brotli is optimized for the web, in particular small text
> documents. It is most effective for serving static content
> such as fonts and html pages.
>
> To use it, install Celery with:
>
> ```
> $ pip install celery[brotli]
> ```

- bzip2


> bzip2 creates smaller files than gzip, but compression and
> decompression speeds are noticeably slower than those of gzip.
>
> To use it, please ensure your Python executable was compiled
> with bzip2 support.
>
> If you get the following [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "(in Python v3.15)"):
>
> ```
> >>> import bz2
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
> ImportError: No module named 'bz2'
> ```
>
> it means that you should recompile your Python version with bzip2 support.

- gzip


> gzip is suitable for systems that require a small memory footprint,
> making it ideal for systems with limited memory. It is often
> used to generate files with the “.tar.gz” extension.
>
> To use it, please ensure your Python executable was compiled
> with gzip support.
>
> If you get the following [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "(in Python v3.15)"):
>
> ```
> >>> import gzip
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
> ImportError: No module named 'gzip'
> ```
>
> it means that you should recompile your Python version with gzip support.

- lzma


> lzma provides a good compression ratio and executes with
> fast compression and decompression speeds at the expense
> of higher memory usage.
>
> To use it, please ensure your Python executable was compiled
> with lzma support and that your Python version is 3.3 and above.
>
> If you get the following [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "(in Python v3.15)"):

You can also create your own compression schemes and register
them in the [`kombu compression registry`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/projects/kombu/en/main/reference/kombu.compression.html#kombu.compression.register "(in Kombu v5.6)").

The following order is used to decide the compression scheme
used when sending a task:

> 1. The compression execution option.
>
> 2. The `Task.compression` attribute.
>
> 3. The [`task_compression`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-task_compression) attribute.

Example specifying the compression used when calling a task:

```
>>> add.apply_async((2, 2), compression='zlib')
```

## [Connections](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#id10) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#connections "Link to this heading")

Automatic Pool Support

Since version 2.3 there’s support for automatic connection pools,
so you don’t have to manually handle connections and publishers
to reuse connections.

The connection pool is enabled by default since version 2.5.

See the [`broker_pool_limit`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-broker_pool_limit) setting for more information.

You can handle the connection manually by creating a
publisher:

```
numbers = [(2, 2), (4, 4), (8, 8), (16, 16)]
results = []
with add.app.pool.acquire(block=True) as connection:
    with add.get_publisher(connection) as publisher:
        try:
            for i, j in numbers:
                res = add.apply_async((i, j), publisher=publisher)
                results.append(res)
print([res.get() for res in results])
```

Though this particular example is much better expressed as a group:

```
>>> from celery import group

>>> numbers = [(2, 2), (4, 4), (8, 8), (16, 16)]
>>> res = group(add.s(i, j) for i, j in numbers).apply_async()

>>> res.get()
[4, 8, 16, 32]
```

## [Routing options](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#id11) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#routing-options "Link to this heading")

Celery can route tasks to different queues.

Simple routing (name <-> name) is accomplished using the `queue` option:

```
add.apply_async(queue='priority.high')
```

You can then assign workers to the `priority.high` queue by using
the workers [`-Q`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-worker-Q) argument:

```
$ celery -A proj worker -l INFO -Q celery,priority.high
```

See also

Hard-coding queue names in code isn’t recommended, the best practice
is to use configuration routers ( [`task_routes`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-task_routes)).

To find out more about routing, please see [Routing Tasks](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/routing.html#guide-routing).

## [Results options](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#id12) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#results-options "Link to this heading")

You can enable or disable result storage using the [`task_ignore_result`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-task_ignore_result)
setting or by using the `ignore_result` option:

```
>>> result = add.apply_async((1, 2), ignore_result=True)
>>> result.get()
None

>>> # Do not ignore result (default)
...
>>> result = add.apply_async((1, 2), ignore_result=False)
>>> result.get()
3
```

If you’d like to store additional metadata about the task in the result backend
set the [`result_extended`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-result_extended) setting to `True`.

Note

`result_extended` controls what _Celery_ includes as extended task metadata,
but it does not automatically add scheduler-specific metadata.
For example, some integrations (e.g. [https://pypi.org/project/django-celery-beat/](https://pypi.org/project/django-celery-beat/) together with
[https://pypi.org/project/django-celery-results/](https://pypi.org/project/django-celery-results/)) may record the _periodic task name_ in the result
backend only when the scheduler provides it as part of the published message.

When you call tasks manually using `apply_async`/`delay`, that periodic task
context is usually not present unless you add it explicitly (e.g. via message
headers/properties in `apply_async` options). For example:

```
result = task.apply_async(
    headers={"periodic_task_name": "task_name"},
)
```

### Advanced Options [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/calling.html\#advanced-options "Link to this heading")

These options are for advanced users who want to take use of
AMQP’s full routing capabilities. Interested parties may read the
[routing guide](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/routing.html#guide-routing).

- exchange


> Name of exchange (or a [`kombu.entity.Exchange`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/internals/reference/celery.backends.rpc.html#celery.backends.rpc.RPCBackend.Exchange "kombu.entity.Exchange")) to
> send the message to.

- routing\_key


> Routing key used to determine.

- priority


> A number between 0 and 255, where 255 is the highest priority.
>
> Supported by: RabbitMQ, Redis (priority reversed, 0 is highest).
