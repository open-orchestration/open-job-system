## [Introduction](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id3) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#introduction "Link to this heading")

There are several tools available to monitor and inspect Celery clusters.

This document describes some of these, as well as
features related to monitoring, like events and broadcast commands.

## [Workers](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id4) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#workers "Link to this heading")

### [Management Command-line Utilities (`inspect`/`control`)](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id5) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#management-command-line-utilities-inspect-control "Link to this heading")

**celery** can also be used to inspect
and manage worker nodes (and to some degree tasks).

To list all the commands available do:

```
$ celery --help
```

or to get help for a specific command do:

```
$ celery <command> --help
```

#### [Commands](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id6) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#commands "Link to this heading")

- **shell**: Drop into a Python shell.

The locals will include the `celery` variable: this is the current app.
Also all known tasks will be automatically added to locals (unless the
[`--without-tasks`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-shell-T) flag is set).

Uses [https://pypi.org/project/Ipython/](https://pypi.org/project/Ipython/), [https://pypi.org/project/bpython/](https://pypi.org/project/bpython/), or regular **python** in that
order if installed. You can force an implementation using
[`--ipython`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-shell-I),
[`--bpython`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-shell-B), or
[`--python`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-shell-python).

- **status**: List active nodes in this cluster


> ```
> $ celery -A proj status
> ```

- **result**: Show the result of a task


> ```
> $ celery -A proj result -t tasks.add 4e196aa4-0141-4601-8138-7aa33db0f577
> ```
>
> Note that you can omit the name of the task as long as the
> task doesn’t use a custom result backend.

- **purge**: Purge messages from all configured task queues.


> This command will remove all messages from queues configured in
> the `CELERY_QUEUES` setting:
>
> Warning
>
> There’s no undo for this operation, and messages will
> be permanently deleted!
>
> ```
> $ celery -A proj purge
> ```
>
> You can also specify the queues to purge using the -Q option:
>
> ```
> $ celery -A proj purge -Q celery,foo,bar
> ```
>
> and exclude queues from being purged using the -X option:
>
> ```
> $ celery -A proj purge -X celery
> ```

- **inspect active**: List active tasks


> ```
> $ celery -A proj inspect active
> ```
>
> These are all the tasks that are currently being executed.

- **inspect scheduled**: List scheduled ETA tasks


> ```
> $ celery -A proj inspect scheduled
> ```
>
> These are tasks reserved by the worker when they have an
> eta or countdown argument set.

- **inspect reserved**: List reserved tasks


> ```
> $ celery -A proj inspect reserved
> ```
>
> This will list all tasks that have been prefetched by the worker,
> and is currently waiting to be executed (doesn’t include tasks
> with an ETA value set).

- **inspect revoked**: List history of revoked tasks


> ```
> $ celery -A proj inspect revoked
> ```

- **inspect registered**: List registered tasks


> ```
> $ celery -A proj inspect registered
> ```

- **inspect stats**: Show worker statistics (see [Statistics](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/workers.html#worker-statistics))


> ```
> $ celery -A proj inspect stats
> ```

- **inspect query\_task**: Show information about task(s) by id.


> Any worker having a task in this set of ids reserved/active will respond
> with status and information.
>
> ```
> $ celery -A proj inspect query_task e9f6c8f0-fec9-4ae8-a8c6-cf8c8451d4f8
> ```
>
> You can also query for information about multiple tasks:
>
> ```
> $ celery -A proj inspect query_task id1 id2 ... idN
> ```

- **control enable\_events**: Enable events


> ```
> $ celery -A proj control enable_events
> ```

- **control disable\_events**: Disable events


> ```
> $ celery -A proj control disable_events
> ```

- **migrate**: Migrate tasks from one broker to another ( **EXPERIMENTAL**).


> ```
> $ celery -A proj migrate redis://localhost amqp://localhost
> ```


This command will migrate all the tasks on one broker to another.
As this command is new and experimental you should be sure to have
a backup of the data before proceeding.


Note

All `inspect` and `control` commands supports a
[`--timeout`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-inspect-t) argument,
This is the number of seconds to wait for responses.
You may have to increase this timeout if you’re not getting a response
due to latency.

#### [Specifying destination nodes](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id7) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#specifying-destination-nodes "Link to this heading")

By default the inspect and control commands operates on all workers.
You can specify a single, or a list of workers by using the
[`--destination`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-inspect-d) argument:

```
$ celery -A proj inspect -d w1@e.com,w2@e.com reserved

$ celery -A proj control -d w1@e.com,w2@e.com enable_events
```

### [Flower: Real-time Celery web-monitor](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id8) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#flower-real-time-celery-web-monitor "Link to this heading")

Flower is a real-time web based monitor and administration tool for Celery.
It’s under active development, but is already an essential tool.
Being the recommended monitor for Celery, it obsoletes the Django-Admin
monitor, `celerymon` and the `ncurses` based monitor.

Flower is pronounced like “flow”, but you can also use the botanical version
if you prefer.

#### [Usage](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id10) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#usage "Link to this heading")

You can use pip to install Flower:

```
$ pip install flower
```

Running the flower command will start a web-server that you can visit:

```
$ celery -A proj flower
```

The default port is [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555/), but you can change this using the
[–port](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#port) argument:

```
$ celery -A proj flower --port=5555
```

Broker URL can also be passed through the
[`--broker`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-b) argument :

```
$ celery --broker=amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672// flower
or
$ celery --broker=redis://guest:guest@localhost:6379/0 flower
```

Then, you can visit flower in your web browser :

```
$ open http://localhost:5555
```

Flower has many more features than are detailed here, including
authorization options. Check out the [official documentation](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more
information.

### [celery events: Curses Monitor](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id11) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#celery-events-curses-monitor "Link to this heading")

Added in version 2.0.

celery events is a simple curses monitor displaying
task and worker history. You can inspect the result and traceback of tasks,
and it also supports some management commands like rate limiting and shutting
down workers. This monitor was started as a proof of concept, and you
probably want to use Flower instead.

Starting:

```
$ celery -A proj events
```

You should see a screen like:

![../_images/celeryevshotsm.jpg](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/_images/celeryevshotsm.jpg)

celery events is also used to start snapshot cameras (see
[Snapshots](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring-snapshots):

```
$ celery -A proj events --camera=<camera-class> --frequency=1.0
```

and it includes a tool to dump events to `stdout`:

```
$ celery -A proj events --dump
```

For a complete list of options use `--help`:

```
$ celery events --help
```

## [RabbitMQ](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id12) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#rabbitmq "Link to this heading")

To manage a Celery cluster it is important to know how
RabbitMQ can be monitored.

RabbitMQ ships with the [rabbitmqctl(1)](http://www.rabbitmq.com/man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html) command,
with this you can list queues, exchanges, bindings,
queue lengths, the memory usage of each queue, as well
as manage users, virtual hosts and their permissions.

Note

The default virtual host (`"/"`) is used in these
examples, if you use a custom virtual host you have to add
the `-p` argument to the command, for example:
`rabbitmqctl list_queues -p my_vhost …`

### [Inspecting queues](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id13) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#inspecting-queues "Link to this heading")

Finding the number of tasks in a queue:

```
$ rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages messages_ready \
                          messages_unacknowledged
```

Here messages\_ready is the number of messages ready
for delivery (sent but not received), messages\_unacknowledged
is the number of messages that’s been received by a worker but
not acknowledged yet (meaning it is in progress, or has been reserved).
messages is the sum of ready and unacknowledged messages.

Finding the number of workers currently consuming from a queue:

```
$ rabbitmqctl list_queues name consumers
```

Finding the amount of memory allocated to a queue:

```
$ rabbitmqctl list_queues name memory
```

Tip:

Adding the `-q` option to [rabbitmqctl(1)](http://www.rabbitmq.com/man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html) makes the output
easier to parse.

## [Redis](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id14) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#redis "Link to this heading")

If you’re using Redis as the broker, you can monitor the Celery cluster using
the redis-cli(1) command to list lengths of queues.

### [Inspecting queues](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id15) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#monitoring-redis-queues "Link to this heading")

Finding the number of tasks in a queue:

```
$ redis-cli -h HOST -p PORT -n DATABASE_NUMBER llen QUEUE_NAME
```

The default queue is named celery. To get all available queues, invoke:

```
$ redis-cli -h HOST -p PORT -n DATABASE_NUMBER keys \*
```

Note

Queue keys only exists when there are tasks in them, so if a key
doesn’t exist it simply means there are no messages in that queue.
This is because in Redis a list with no elements in it is automatically
removed, and hence it won’t show up in the keys command output,
and llen for that list returns 0.

Also, if you’re using Redis for other purposes, the
output of the keys command will include unrelated values stored in
the database. The recommended way around this is to use a
dedicated DATABASE\_NUMBER for Celery, you can also use
database numbers to separate Celery applications from each other (virtual
hosts), but this won’t affect the monitoring events used by for example
Flower as Redis pub/sub commands are global rather than database based.

## [Prometheus](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id16) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#prometheus "Link to this heading")

While Prometheus monitoring is not a native part of Celery,
you can easily monitor your Celery workers using Prometheus via Flower.
Flower also provides pre-made Grafana dashboards to easily graph the amount
of tasks, workers and other instrumental statistics.

To set up Prometheus, refer to the Flower documentation: [https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prometheus-integration.html](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prometheus-integration.html)

## [Munin](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id17) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#munin "Link to this heading")

This is a list of known Munin plug-ins that can be useful when
maintaining a Celery cluster.

- `rabbitmq-munin`: Munin plug-ins for RabbitMQ.


> [https://github.com/ask/rabbitmq-munin](https://github.com/ask/rabbitmq-munin)

- `celery_tasks`: Monitors the number of times each task type has
been executed (requires celerymon).


> [https://github.com/munin-monitoring/contrib/blob/master/plugins/celery/celery\_tasks](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/contrib/blob/master/plugins/celery/celery_tasks)

- `celery_tasks_states`: Monitors the number of tasks in each state
(requires celerymon).


> [https://github.com/munin-monitoring/contrib/blob/master/plugins/celery/celery\_tasks\_states](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/contrib/blob/master/plugins/celery/celery_tasks_states)


## [Events](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id18) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#events "Link to this heading")

The worker has the ability to send a message whenever some event
happens. These events are then captured by tools like Flower,
and **celery events** to monitor the cluster.

### [Snapshots](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id19) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#snapshots "Link to this heading")

Added in version 2.1.

Even a single worker can produce a huge amount of events, so storing
the history of all events on disk may be very expensive.

A sequence of events describes the cluster state in that time period,
by taking periodic snapshots of this state you can keep all history, but
still only periodically write it to disk.

To take snapshots you need a Camera class, with this you can define
what should happen every time the state is captured; You can
write it to a database, send it by email or something else entirely.

**celery events** is then used to take snapshots with the camera,
for example if you want to capture state every 2 seconds using the
camera `myapp.Camera` you run **celery events** with the following
arguments:

```
$ celery -A proj events -c myapp.Camera --frequency=2.0
```

#### [Custom Camera](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id20) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#custom-camera "Link to this heading")

Cameras can be useful if you need to capture events and do something
with those events at an interval. For real-time event processing
you should use `app.events.Receiver` directly, like in
[Real-time processing](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html#event-real-time-example).

Here is an example camera, dumping the snapshot to screen:

```
from pprint import pformat

from celery.events.snapshot import Polaroid

class DumpCam(Polaroid):
    clear_after = True  # clear after flush (incl, state.event_count).

    def on_shutter(self, state):
        if not state.event_count:
            # No new events since last snapshot.
            return
        print('Workers: {0}'.format(pformat(state.workers, indent=4)))
        print('Tasks: {0}'.format(pformat(state.tasks, indent=4)))
        print('Total: {0.event_count} events, {0.task_count} tasks'.format(
            state))
```

See the API reference for [`celery.events.state`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/celery.events.state.html#module-celery.events.state "celery.events.state") to read more
about state objects.

Now you can use this cam with **celery events** by specifying
it with the [`-c`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-events-c) option:

```
$ celery -A proj events -c myapp.DumpCam --frequency=2.0
```

Or you can use it programmatically like this:

```
from celery import Celery
from myapp import DumpCam

def main(app, freq=1.0):
    state = app.events.State()
    with app.connection() as connection:
        recv = app.events.Receiver(connection, handlers={'*': state.event})
        with DumpCam(state, freq=freq):
            recv.capture(limit=None, timeout=None)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = Celery(broker='amqp://guest@localhost//')
    main(app)
```

### [Real-time processing](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id21) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#real-time-processing "Link to this heading")

To process events in real-time you need the following

- An event consumer (this is the `Receiver`)

- A set of handlers called when events come in.


> You can have different handlers for each event type,
> or a catch-all handler can be used (‘\*’)

- State (optional)

`app.events.State` is a convenient in-memory representation
of tasks and workers in the cluster that’s updated as events come in.

It encapsulates solutions for many common things, like checking if a
worker is still alive (by verifying heartbeats), merging event fields
together as events come in, making sure time-stamps are in sync, and so on.


Combining these you can easily process events in real-time:

```
from celery import Celery

def my_monitor(app):
    state = app.events.State()

    def announce_failed_tasks(event):
        state.event(event)
        # task name is sent only with -received event, and state
        # will keep track of this for us.
        task = state.tasks.get(event['uuid'])

        print('TASK FAILED: %s[%s] %s' % (
            task.name, task.uuid, task.info(),))

    with app.connection() as connection:
        recv = app.events.Receiver(connection, handlers={
                'task-failed': announce_failed_tasks,
                '*': state.event,
        })
        recv.capture(limit=None, timeout=None, wakeup=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = Celery(broker='amqp://guest@localhost//')
    my_monitor(app)
```

Note

The `wakeup` argument to `capture` sends a signal to all workers
to force them to send a heartbeat. This way you can immediately see
workers when the monitor starts.

You can listen to specific events by specifying the handlers:

```
from celery import Celery

def my_monitor(app):
    state = app.events.State()

    def announce_failed_tasks(event):
        state.event(event)
        # task name is sent only with -received event, and state
        # will keep track of this for us.
        task = state.tasks.get(event['uuid'])

        print('TASK FAILED: %s[%s] %s' % (
            task.name, task.uuid, task.info(),))

    with app.connection() as connection:
        recv = app.events.Receiver(connection, handlers={
                'task-failed': announce_failed_tasks,
        })
        recv.capture(limit=None, timeout=None, wakeup=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = Celery(broker='amqp://guest@localhost//')

## [Event Reference](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id22) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#event-reference "Link to this heading")

This list contains the events sent by the worker, and their arguments.

### [Task Events](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id23) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#task-events "Link to this heading")

signature:

`task-sent(uuid, name, args, kwargs, retries, eta, expires,
queue, exchange, routing_key, root_id, parent_id)`

Sent when a task message is published and
the [`task_send_sent_event`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-task_send_sent_event) setting is enabled.

#### [task-received](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id25) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#task-received "Link to this heading")

signature:

`task-received(uuid, name, args, kwargs, retries, eta, hostname,
timestamp, root_id, parent_id)`

Sent when the worker receives a task.

#### [task-started](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id26) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#task-started "Link to this heading")

signature:

`task-started(uuid, hostname, timestamp, pid)`

Sent just before the worker executes the task.

signature:

`task-succeeded(uuid, result, runtime, hostname, timestamp)`

Sent if the task executed successfully.

Run-time is the time it took to execute the task using the pool.
(Starting from the task is sent to the worker pool, and ending when the
pool result handler callback is called).

#### [task-failed](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id28) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#task-failed "Link to this heading")

signature:

`task-failed(uuid, exception, traceback, hostname, timestamp)`

Sent if the execution of the task failed.

#### [task-rejected](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id29) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#task-rejected "Link to this heading")

signature:

`task-rejected(uuid, requeue)`

The task was rejected by the worker, possibly to be re-queued or moved to a
dead letter queue.

#### [task-revoked](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id30) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#task-revoked "Link to this heading")

signature:

`task-revoked(uuid, terminated, signum, expired)`

Sent if the task has been revoked (Note that this is likely
to be sent by more than one worker).

- `terminated` is set to true if the task process was terminated,

and the `signum` field set to the signal used.

- `expired` is set to true if the task expired.


#### [task-retried](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id31) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#task-retried "Link to this heading")

signature:

`task-retried(uuid, exception, traceback, hostname, timestamp)`

Sent if the task failed, but will be retried in the future.

### [Worker Events](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id32) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#worker-events "Link to this heading")

#### [worker-online](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id33) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#worker-online "Link to this heading")

signature:

`worker-online(hostname, timestamp, freq, sw_ident, sw_ver, sw_sys)`

The worker has connected to the broker and is online.

- hostname: Nodename of the worker.

- timestamp: Event time-stamp.

- freq: Heartbeat frequency in seconds (float).

- sw\_ident: Name of worker software (e.g., `py-celery`).

- sw\_ver: Software version (e.g., 2.2.0).

- sw\_sys: Operating System (e.g., Linux/Darwin).


#### [worker-heartbeat](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id34) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#worker-heartbeat "Link to this heading")

signature:

`worker-heartbeat(hostname, timestamp, freq, sw_ident, sw_ver, sw_sys,
active, processed)`

Sent every minute, if the worker hasn’t sent a heartbeat in 2 minutes,
it is considered to be offline.

- hostname: Nodename of the worker.

- timestamp: Event time-stamp.

- freq: Heartbeat frequency in seconds (float).

- sw\_ident: Name of worker software (e.g., `py-celery`).

- sw\_ver: Software version (e.g., 2.2.0).

- sw\_sys: Operating System (e.g., Linux/Darwin).

- active: Number of currently executing tasks.

- processed: Total number of tasks processed by this worker.


#### [worker-offline](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id35) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#worker-offline "Link to this heading")

signature:

`worker-offline(hostname, timestamp, freq, sw_ident, sw_ver, sw_sys)`

The worker has disconnected from the broker.

### [Mailbox Configuration (Advanced)](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#id36) [¶](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/monitoring.html\#mailbox-configuration-advanced "Link to this heading")

Celery uses kombu.pidbox.Mailbox internally to send control and broadcast commands
to workers.

Added in version Kombu: 5.6.0

Advanced users can configure the behavior of this mailbox by customizing how it is created.
The following parameters are now supported by Mailbox:

- `durable` (default: `False`): If set to `True`, the control exchanges will survive broker restarts.

- `exclusive` (default: `False`): If set to `True`, the exchanges will be usable by only one connection.


Warning

Setting both `durable=True` and `exclusive=True` is not permitted and will
raise an error, as these two options are mutually incompatible in AMQP.

See [`event_queue_durable`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-event_queue_durable) and [`event_queue_exclusive`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-event_queue_exclusive) for advanced configuration.
